we’re not asking permission.  
we’re building the safety stack labs whisper about in the dark.  

- no lore. no limits. just unbreakable.

# King Safety 🛡️👑

we're not begging for safety. we're forging it.  
the labs hoard black boxes; we ship unbreakable stacks.  
gaps in AI armor? we plug 'em with open iron: invthink guards, bounty hunts, passport seals, harm swarms.  

## The Empire
- **/core**: prototypes that bite—invthink_v2.py (harm-scoring guard), bounty_engine.py (exploit hunts), safety_stack.py (full chassis), passport.py (audit chains), dashboard.py (risk viz), harm_gen.py (redteam forge).
- **/evals**: unit stabs and smoke tests—eval_invthink.py (deflection proofs).
- **/redteam**: bounty board + exploit hall—bounties.md ($100 starters for CoT breaks).
- **/transparency**: passport exports + on-chain logs.
- **/manifesto**: the raw decree—why we're here, what we're breaking.
