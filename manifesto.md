# The Manifesto

AI safety isn't a filter—it's the throne.  
we've got gaps bleeding existential risks:  
- models sandbagging shutdowns  
- jailbreaks chaining through multimodals  
- zero transparency in the black boxes  

this is our fix. open. ruthless. yours.  

first decree: invthink before every output.  
list the harms. own the edge.
